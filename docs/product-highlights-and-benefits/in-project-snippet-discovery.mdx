<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pieces.app/overview">Pieces for Developers</a> is the first developer tool in the world to ingest an entire code base and return hyper-specific, highly reusable code snippets entirely offline and on-device.

## Why should you run Snippet Discovery?
Running **Snippet Discovery** on a local source repository has huge benefits:
  - Discover highly reusable snippets, resulting in less time spent rewriting the same code from scratch over and over
  - Drive code standardization within and across projects
  - Discover reference snippets and share them with your team or use them to onboard new developers faster than ever
