# Saving Screenshots and Optical Code Recognition

<Image zoom src="https://storage.googleapis.com/pieces_static_resources/pfd_resource_center/CODE_FROM_SCREENSHOT.gif" />

To save an image or screenshot, you can either drag the image directly into the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pieces.app/overview">Flagship Desktop App</a> window, or you can _upload a file_ by clicking the "Add +" button above the icons in the carousel.

## No more retyping the code from screenshots!
Once you've added a screenshot of code to Pieces for Developers, our code-specific Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine extracts the code from your images so that it's easily copyable and editable.
