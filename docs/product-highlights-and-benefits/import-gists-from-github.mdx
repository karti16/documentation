# Import Gists from GitHub

<Image zoom src="https://storage.googleapis.com/pieces_static_resources/pfd_wiki/IMPORT_GIST.gif" />

Import saved code from GitHub with the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pieces.app/overview">Pieces for Developers | Desktop App</a>. When you import Gists, Pieces attaches metadata from the original repo along with PRs, related people, and additional context.

## Gist Metadata
Each code snippet that you save as a Gist is packed full of metadata and information about the repository you saved it from. Traditionally when you save a Gist, its origin can be lost unless you take a lot of extra steps or click through dozens of pull requests and commits.

But when you import the Gists you've already created to Pieces, metadata that was previously hidden can be found in the Information View of Pieces for Developers.
