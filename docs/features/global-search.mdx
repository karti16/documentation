# Global Search

Our <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pieces.app/overview">Flagship Desktop App</a> makes it easier than ever to find what you need when you need it with a blazingly fast search experience.

Instantly find, reference, share or reuse your saved developer materials in a few keystrokes without breaking your flow.

## How to Use Global Search
Global search utilizes semantics to help you associate your search term with a solution to your problem. Many factors play into how and why a snippet shows up when you search and in what order.

## Adjust Settings for Optimal Search Results
Pieces for Developers offers three ways to search within the Desktop App in order to quickly find what you need.

### Blended Search
- Search via multiple query matches, including code, tags, descriptions, and links. This method can be particularly useful for users who need to search for specific information across a variety of sources.

### Full-Text Search
- Search for text values within code, documents, and other text-based sources. This method is particularly useful for users who are looking for specific words or phrases.

### Neural Code Search
- Search by describing what you're looking for using natural language. This method can be particularly useful for users who are not familiar with the specific terminology used in code or who are looking for a more intuitive way to search for information.

## Sorting by Realtime or Scope-Relevant Suggestions

The demands on developers are increasing every day. As a result, a developer's time is becoming ever more precious and anything that boosts productivity is no longer a nice-to-have, but a need-to-have.

With that, our team has invested serious resources into enabling Pieces for Developers to proactively suggest the most relevant materials at the right time.

### Sorting via Scope Relevant Suggestions
We're excited to for you to check out **Sorting via Suggestions**, which is based on your recently saved materials, available in our <a target="_blank" href="{{ links.website.pfd_desktop_install }}">Flagship Desktop App</a>.
