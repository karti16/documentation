## View Metadata & Enrichment Details

Shortcut: ` cmd/ctrl + i `

All background processing that goes into Pieces gives you the ability to access more data around your resources and code snippets. You can view the information by:
- Press ` cmd + i ` or ` ctrl + i ` to access the Context View
- [In List View] pressing the _view all context_ button on the top right of the context preview
- [In Gallery View] press the _manage context_ on the overlay when hovering the 'view all context' button or press the 'view all context' icon itself
    - when hovering this icon you can also click the 'gear' icon to manage how often the overlay appears.

### Saving a Snippets Context
Saving a snippet‚Äôs original context is helpful for organization and future use. Pieces automatically extracts the following contextual information:
- Project Name
- Source File
- Line Numbers
- Collaborators
- Application Source (Chrome, Edge, VS Code, etc.)
- Solution Publishers

---

## Inside the Context View
Once you enter the Context view, you will see data added both automatically via Pieces AI & GPT4, and also that you have [added manually](/features/managing-saved-materials).

Whether you are in List or Gallery View, you will have access to the same set of sections.

### Description

Shortcuts: ` cmd/ctrl + shift + N `

You can press the entire _description_ box to open the "Edit Description Drawer" or use the ` cmd/ctrl + shift + N ` shortcut to edit the contents of the description context field.

This section will by default be filled out, and you can reference the following example:

```text
  üìù Custom Description:
  Write a custom description here.

  üí° Smart Description:
  The article explains how to use the Snipping Tool feature in Windows to capture screenshots.

  üîé Suggested Searches:
  Windows screenshot tool
  How to capture screenshots on Windows
  Microsoft support screenshot guide
  Windows snipping tool tutorial
  Windows screenshot shortcut
```

A few things to note about this format:
**Custom Description**
    - Comes default filled out as "Write a custom description" and is used as a space for you to write your own description
**Smart Description**
    - We auto generate this description and is used for search-ability, reading through your list of snippets, and is a description of what the snippet does.

[//]: # (        - [you can use this feature to identify what a code snippet can do when you aren't sure]&#40;#&#41;)

**Suggested Searches**
    - These are great search terms that you can use to find snippets that are similar to the resource they are attached to. These are good examples that you can compare to the examples found on the [Global Search Page](/features/global-search) and try them in the app.

### Tags

Shortcut: ` cmd/ctrl + t `

Open the Tags drawer by clicking anywhere overtop of the tags section, or by pressing the ` cmd/ctrl + t ` shortcut. This will bring pull up a list of tags that have already been [added when you saved the resource](/product-highlights-and-benefits/in-project-snippet-discovery), along with suggested snippets that you can click to quickly add to the snippet.

To create a custom tag, you can start typing once the drawer opens and add any tag you like directly into the preexisting tags list.

Example Tags:
``` HTTP Request ```, ``` Flutter Framework ```, ``` Dart Project ```, ``` Conditional For Loop ```

#### Types of Tags

**Custom Tags**: tags that you can write yourself and add to your code, that will not contain the sparkle icon

#### Removing Tags
To remove a tag:
- Press the ` X ` icon to the right of a tag's title
- A dialog will open up, and you can press "Delete" to confirm the removal of the tag
    - You can also press ` enter ` or ` return `
- To cancel the deletion, press ` esc ` to go back to the tags drawer
- (optional) you can press "Do not ask me again" to quickly delete a number of tags from a snippet, but we recommend keeping this setting turned on to protect against accidental deletions.

### Related Links

Shortcut: ` cmd/ctrl + k `

Related links can be opened by clicking on the _background_ of the related links section, or via the ` cmd/ctrl + k ` shortcut - clicking any of the individual links directly will cause them to open in your browser when you press them.

Note: In the header of related links, you can see the _total number_ of related links that you have.

<Image alt={"Saving a snippet from Stack Overflow with the Pieces web extension"} zoom src="https://storage.googleapis.com/pieces_static_resources/pfd_wiki/RELATED_LINKS_EXTERNAL_RESOURCES.gif" />

#### Managing Related Links
From inside the Related Links drawer, you can add new links by typing them directly into the text box at the top. Not all text input will be accepted, so it is important to add **a full http url** such as the following: [https://pieces.app/blog]()

**You can quickly copy any related link from inside the Related Links Drawer by pressing the copy button on the right side of the Related link pill**

**Auto Generated**
- links that are added the moment you save a resource to Pieces, and contain a ` sparkle ` icon proceeding the tag name
- also will include the favicon of the website it has come from inside the related link pill

**Custom Links**:
- links that you can write yourself and add to your code, that will not contain the sparkle icon
- will still include the favicon of the website

#### Deleting Related Links
To remove a specific link from the resource it is attached to, inside the Related Links drawer:
- Press the ` trashcan ` icon next to the ` copy ` icon on the right side of the related link
- A confirmation drawer will open up, where you can confirm the removal by pressing ` Delete ` button
    - You can also press ` enter ` or ` return `
- To cancel the deletion, press ` esc ` to go back to the Related Links drawer
- (optional) you can press "Do not ask me again" to quickly delete a number of tags from a snippet, but we recommend keeping this setting turned on to protect against accidental deletions.

### Sharable Links

Shortcut: ` cmd/ctrl + l `

Sharable links are accessible from this view, and can be opened using the ` cmd/ctrl + l ` shortcut or by clicking on the section inside the Context View. This will open the Sharable Link Drawer where you can manage the sharable link for a specific resource.

**Note that all Resources have their own unique sharable link, and each have to be generated on their own.**

Read about all the ins and outs of sharable links on the [One Click Snippet Sharing Page](/features/one-click-snippet-sharing).

### Related People

Shortcut: ` cmd/ctrl + p `

To facilitate communication among and between teams, Pieces for Developers attaches Related People to your saved snippets. Related People include content authors, open-source maintainers, GitHub collaborators, and others who are part of a snippet‚Äôs context.

To access related People, you can click the Related People section or press the ` cmd/ctrl + p ` shortcut.

<Image alt={"Showing related people on a snippet with a sharable link."} zoom src="https://storage.googleapis.com/pieces_static_resources/pfd_wiki/RELATED_PEOPLE.gif" />

#### Managing Related People
If a snippet is saved from a location locally that has no crossover with other users, it is likely that when you save a snippet it will have the following message:
-  "No People Detected"
    - The advantage to saving snippets by [importing them from GitHub gists](/product-highlights-and-benefits/import-gists-from-github) is other users who have commented on the PR, contributed to the repo, or any other involvement will show up here under related users.

[//]: # ([Learn more about Migrating from GitHub to Pieces Desktop]&#40;#&#41;)

#### Adding Related People Manually
You can add related people manually with their name and email to any resource. When you share that resource, the information that you have attached will be included.

It requires two fields:
1. A name for the user to display in the related people section
2. An email for the user that is related to the snippet.

If a related person is added to your list of People and you wish to remove it, you can do so by clicking the ` edit ` pencil icon when you hover the Related Person in the Related People Drawer. Once you are in the edit drawer, you can click ` delete ` next to the ` save ` Button on the bottom of the drawer and the Related Person will be removed.

### Security Practices
<Image alt={"Protecting Sensitive information from being shared."} zoom src="https://storage.googleapis.com/pieces_static_resources/pfd_wiki/SENSITIVE.gif" />

<a target="_blank" href="https://pieces.app">Pieces for Developers</a> facilitates security and programming best practices by detecting sensitive information and warning against accidental uploads or sharing.

#### Smart Warnings and Sensitive Information Detection
Some of the most commonly saved snippets are Powershell and Command Line instructions, boilerplate for unit tests, .env variables, HTTP requests, and CI/CD build configs. These often contain sensitive data like API keys, auth tokens, usernames, passwords, or service account credentials.
