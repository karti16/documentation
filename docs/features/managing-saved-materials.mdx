# Managing Saved Materials

Once you save a material you can edit, rename, reclassify and modify metadata to adjust it over time.

## Editing saved Code Snippets and Text Notes

As we progress deeper into our projects, frameworks and dependencies often change, which means we might need to adjust a saved snippet to comply with breaking changes or conform to new standards. Click on the pencil in the upper-right corner of the Pieces Desktop App to quickly and easily edit a saved snippet so your code can stay relevant and up-to-date.

## Renaming Saved Materials

We're on a mission to make it as frictionless as possible for our users to save snippets without disrupting their flow. The AI in Pieces for Developers will attempt to add a relevant name for your snippets automatically, so you don't have to. Don't worry, you can rename your snippets anytime to a convention that works best for you. All you need to do is right-click a snippet in the List View and select "Rename".

## Reclassifying a Code Snippet's Language Association

When you save a material to Pieces for Developers, our AI works hard to understand what you saved so that we can successfully add as much helpful metadata - tags, related links & websites, related people, etc. - as possible.

One of our fundamental capabilities is Instant Language Detection, which automatically detects the language of your snippet and supports over 40 programming languages, including Typescript, Javascript, Python, Dart, C++, C#, and many more. Unfortunately, we don't always get it right, so we made it as easy as possible to reclassify a snippet to the proper language. Simply right-click a snippet in the List View and select "Reclassify".

## Deleting a Saved Material

Since we made it so simple to save snippets from the <a target="_blank" href="{{ links.extensions.chrome }}">browser</a>, your IDE, or with our <a target="_blank" href="{{ links.website.pfd_desktop_install }}">Flagship Desktop App</a>, users are saving hundreds of snippets throughout their time researching, coding, and collaborating. For some, this can get a little chaotic. If you find yourself looking to do a little spring cleaning, you can delete snippets by hitting your delete key.
